# Connector commands and Graph x Chain views: evidence

Recorded 2026-10-19 on branch `feat/connector-commands-got-views`. Each row states what was observed and how it was observed. Secret values are never written here. Nothing here proves how Claude or Grok behave as clients: neither has connected to this build (see [Not verified](#not-verified)).

## Change set

Six commits on top of `e461875` (57 files, +9,901 and -238 lines) plus the commit that adds this record. The six are additive to the five plugin hosts (see the regression row below).

| Commit | Subject |
|---|---|
| `3a13cba` | Graph x Chain views for plans: structured graph, wave tree, Mermaid, the MCP App card |
| `d676a5d` | Slash commands through prompts, tools and resources; request-log diagnostics |
| `c0f52ab` | Claude plugin bundle and the local stdio server |
| `d8a3c7e` | Fixes from the independent code and security reviews |
| `42e675a` | Documentation for every client, the command reference, runbook section 13 |
| `8c3d4f8` | Fixes from the cross-phase integration check |

Before this record was added, the branch was 24 commits ahead of `origin/main`. The other 18 are earlier local commits that were never pushed: the hosted connector service with its OAuth, planner and deployment files (`services/ultrathink/**`, `deploy/**`, `docs/ops/**`), the Omp token-optimization plugin (`plugins/omp-token-opt/**`, 34 files), one Grok Bot skill file, a type fix in `src/host/omp-ui.test.ts`, the CI workflow and `package.json`. A pull request into `origin/main` carries all of them; at that point the whole branch was 136 files, +28,879 and -83 lines.

## Decisions on record

| Date | Decision | By |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-19 | Blocking clarification q3 (how the connector's reasoning sessions relate to the existing thinking graph and pipeline): reuse the existing graph types and expose the existing planning pipeline. No standalone passive session engine now; it stays an extension point. | The maintainer, when asked |
| 2026-10-19 | Publish all 24 commits in one pull request, including the 18 earlier local commits. | The maintainer, when asked |
| 2026-10-19 | The GSD milestone stays open: the live-client checks below are still to be run. | The maintainer, when asked |

## Five-host regression

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `git diff --stat e461875..HEAD -- hosts src hooks commands skills .claude-plugin .muse-plugin .omp-plugin scripts bin ultrathink.discovery.json` | Exactly one file: the new `bin/ultrathink-connector` (+16 lines). No host adapter, hook, command, skill or manifest of the Omp, Hermes, Muse Code, Claude Code or Grok Build hosts changed in the six commits. |
| Same paths in the working tree | No uncommitted change. |
| Host test suites | The adapter suites of all five hosts and of Grok Bot are part of `bun test`, which passes in full (next table). The Hermes and Prime Agent bridge tests pass. |
| The 18 earlier commits | Outside the guard above, because they predate this work. Under the guarded paths they changed only `hosts/grok-bot/remote/ultrathink-remote/SKILL.md` and `src/host/omp-ui.test.ts`; the rest is `services/`, `deploy/`, `docs/` and `plugins/omp-token-opt/`. |

## Gates on the final tree (`8c3d4f8`)

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun run verify` (`bun run check`, `bun test`, Hermes bridge test, Prime Agent bridge test) | Exit 0. 4,491 pass, 4 skip, 0 fail across 164 files. Prime Agent bridge: 11 tests OK. |
| `bun run check:services` | Clean. |
| Independent code review | 0 Critical, High or Medium; 6 Low, all fixed in `d8a3c7e`. |
| Independent security review | First verdict OPEN_THREATS (1 Medium: model-written node text reached the chat reply unfenced). The Medium and 4 Low are fixed in `d8a3c7e`; 4 Info notes are accepted with reasons (wildcard `targetOrigin` inside the sandbox, `mcpVersion` logged before auth but cut and encoded, host CSS applied by design, the plugin names the production URL). |
| Independent cross-phase integration check | 6 end-to-end flows. 1 Medium (a plan that `ultrathink_uplift` already reports as planned never reached the card or the model) and 7 Low, all fixed in `8c3d4f8`. |

## Client and transport checks

Run against a local instance of the service in client-driven mode with throwaway secrets, and against the stdio server. Production was not touched.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.32.1 | connect, `tools/list` (9), `prompts/list` (6), `prompts/get`, `resources/list` and `read`, `ultrathink_plan`, `ultrathink_status`, `ultrathink_sessions`, `ultrathink_graph` (8 nodes), `ultrathink_command help` (22), ping, terminate: all pass. |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/client` 2.3.1, legacy mode and auto mode | Same matrix passes. In auto mode the client first sends `server/discover` with `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28`, gets HTTP 400 / -32600 and falls back to `initialize`. |
| stdio server with the SDK's stdio client | 8 checks pass: 9 tools, 6 prompts, the card resource (about 41 KB), `ultrathink_graph` on a stored plan, `ultrathink_sessions`, `ultrathink_plan` returns `needs-model`, `ultrathink_command`. The only stderr line is the JSON `started` log. |
| Raw HTTP smoke | `initialize` at 2025-11-25 with `tools`, `prompts`, `resources` and the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension; 22-command help; unsupported command and unknown prompt answers; `prompts/list` and `resources/list` without credentials return 401; the 2026-07-28 probe returns 400 / -32600 and is logged with `mcpVersion` and `rpcMethod`. |
| Mermaid | 12 graphs (this milestone's own plan, a diamond, 8 hostile ones, a cycle, duplicate ids) parse and render in Mermaid 11 `strict` in headless Chrome 153 with no injected node, link or script. |
| MCP App card in a dev host | In headless Chrome 153 through `services/ultrathink/ui/harness/`: handshake, selection, keyboard, dark and narrow layouts, a running plan that polls, questions with `ui/message`, hostile text rendered inert, no CSP or network violation. A real plan served by the local connector renders with 8 cards, 3 placeholder cards, the degraded notice and 3 questions. A plan that `ultrathink_uplift` already reports as planned makes one `ultrathink_result` call; with no `tools/call` support it makes none; a refused call shows one note and does not loop. |
| Docs against code | The 22-row table in `docs/commands.md` equals the loaded catalog (4 native, 1 alias, 1 passthrough, 16 unsupported). Rate limits and field names in runbook section 13 match `auth/auth.ts` and `routes/router.ts`. |

## Not verified

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Claude Desktop, claude.ai, Claude Code and Grok Chat connecting to this connector | Needs the operator's accounts. The setup steps and the expected behavior per client are in [Use /ultrathink in Claude, Claude Code and Grok Chat](../how-to/use-ultrathink-in-chat.md), each marked with its source or *not verified*. |
| Whether Claude or Grok render a fenced Mermaid block | No vendor document says so; the plan text leads with a wave tree for that reason. |
| The MCP App inside Claude | Only run in the dev host harness; custom connectors are reported to render MCP Apps inconsistently. |
| Typed slash commands from the plugin bundle in claude.ai, and `$ARGUMENTS` in chat-loaded plugin commands | The plugin upload was not run. |
| Server-side planning (`ultrathink_uplift`) on this build against a real model | Needs the service user's Claude plan login and spends plan usage; the code path is covered by the headless tests and the shared view code. |
| The Windows stdio invocation | No Windows host here. |
| The first real connection's protocol fallback | Confirmed for the official SDKs only; runbook section 13 shows how to read it from the log. |
