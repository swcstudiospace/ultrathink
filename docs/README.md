# ultrathink documentation

ultrathink plans every non-trivial prompt into a spec and a Graph of Thought before your coding agent starts, and can track the plan in Notion or Linear. New here? Start with [Getting started](getting-started.md).

## Start here

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): from nothing to a first planned prompt, then to a first tracked plan.
- [Install](install.md): install, verify, update and remove ultrathink on Claude Code, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, Muse Code, Omp and Prime Agent.
- [What leaves your machine](privacy.md): which services ultrathink contacts, what it sends, and what stays local.
- [FAQ](faq.md): short answers to common questions.

## How-to guides

- [Set up Notion](how-to/set-up-notion.md): log in, create or reuse the tracking database, verify.
- [Set up Linear](how-to/set-up-linear.md): log in with OAuth or an API key, choose the team, verify.
- [Register the MCP gateway](how-to/register-mcp-gateway.md): give every host's agent the Notion, Linear and Greptile tools.
- [Choose the engine](how-to/choose-engine.md): plan with your host's own engine (Claude, Grok or Muse, or on Omp the session's own model), name another one, and read the four planning model states.
- [Work without paid inference](how-to/work-without-paid-inference.md): what keeps working with no paid model access, what needs a paid route and its exact message, the fallback order, and the owner actions that remain.
- [Ship with Greptile](how-to/ship-with-greptile.md): opt in to the pull request, Greptile review and merge flow.
- [Use the Greptile knowledge base](how-to/use-greptile-knowledge-base.md): opt in to reading the repository's Greptile knowledge base before the clarifying questions.
- [Use Jev decisions](how-to/use-jev-decisions.md): store a Jev key for the always-on decision model at the plan, ship, knowledge, blocking, teachable and skillworthy points, check it over OpenRouter, tune its thresholds and pin the model.
- [Connect Hindsight](how-to/connect-hindsight.md): opt in to the Hindsight memory server, store the key, check it and prove a round trip.
- [Connect RAGFlow](how-to/connect-ragflow.md): opt in to RAGFlow document search, check it without the healthz probe, and turn grounding on.
- [Use Teachable Moments](how-to/use-teachable-moments.md): capture, confirm, recall and promote lessons. On by default.
- [Teachable Moments on Hermes](how-to/teachable-moments-on-hermes.md): the observe hook, the lesson tools and commands, and why Hermes only gets a skill draft.
- [Reduce cost and latency](how-to/reduce-cost-and-latency.md): fewer engine calls per prompt, or none for small messages.
- [Headless and CI](how-to/headless-and-ci.md): run hosts in scripts without planning or tracking.
- [Team and project config](how-to/team-and-project-config.md): share settings per repository and layer them with your own.
- [Upgrade and move](how-to/upgrade-and-move.md): update each host and move the clone.
- [Uninstall](how-to/uninstall.md): remove ultrathink from each host, plus its shared config, credentials and state.
- [Use with Grok Bot](how-to/use-with-grok-bot.md): the native Grok Bot host (`bin/ultrathink-grokbot` plus skills; no prompt hook).
- [Use /ultrathink in Claude, Claude Code and Grok Chat](how-to/use-ultrathink-in-chat.md): connect the hosted connector or the local stdio server to each client, with what is and is not verified per client.
- [Run pstack skills beside GSD in Cursor](how-to/use-pstack-with-cursor.md): install the Cursor hook, enable it in your user config, and check it with doctor.
- [Self-host ultrathink](how-to/self-host.md): run the hosted service (`/mcp`, OAuth, the owner login, `/healthz` and `/readyz`) on a machine you control, with variables you supply.
- [Bring your own variables](how-to/bring-your-own-variables.md): where your own values go for the plugin on a host, the stdio connector and the hosted service, and which variables the code reads.

## Reference

- [Configuration](configuration.md): config files, every key and its default, environment variables, state directories.
- [Commands](commands.md): the `/ultrathink-*` commands, prompt prefixes and the `bin/` CLIs.
- [Environment](environment.md): every environment variable the code reads, its aliases, what it accepts and which are secrets (generated).
- [Realm](integration/realm.md): the read-only Realm seam, what it does and does not give you under Omp, and what ultrathink asks of Realm.
- [Runbook: the hosted connector](ops/runbook-ultrathink.md): operate the hosted server, including the connector inventory, the log fields and the smoke checks (section 13).
- [Evidence: connector commands and graph views](ops/evidence-connector-commands.md): what was run for the command surface, the graph views, the stdio server and the plugin bundle, and what was not.
