# Uninstall ultrathink

This guide removes ultrathink completely: from each host, from the host settings that `scripts/setup.ts` and `scripts/mcp-register.ts` changed, and from your machine (credentials, config and state). Do the steps in order. Steps 2 and 3 run scripts from the clone with Bun, so delete the clone last.

In the commands below, `<clone>` is the absolute path of your checkout. Paths written as `${NAME:-default}` use the environment variable when you set it, and the default otherwise.

1. [Remove the plugin from each host](#1-remove-the-plugin-from-each-host)
2. [Undo `scripts/setup.ts apply`](#2-undo-scriptssetupts-apply)
3. [Remove the MCP gateway entries](#3-remove-the-mcp-gateway-entries)
4. [Delete stored credentials](#4-delete-stored-credentials)
5. [Delete config files](#5-delete-config-files)
6. [Delete planning state](#6-delete-planning-state)
7. [Delete the clone](#7-delete-the-clone)

Rows ultrathink created in Notion and Linear are not touched. See [What stays in Notion and Linear](#what-stays-in-notion-and-linear).
A Hindsight bank and any RAGFlow datasets are not touched either. See [What stays on Hindsight and RAGFlow](#what-stays-on-hindsight-and-ragflow).

## 1. Remove the plugin from each host

Skip the hosts you don't use.

### Claude Code

```sh
claude plugin uninstall ultrathink@ultrathink
claude plugin marketplace remove ultrathink
```

`scripts/setup.ts rollback` (step 2) prints these two commands but does not run them. Restart Claude Code afterwards.

### Grok Build

```sh
grok plugin disable ultrathink
rm ${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/plugins/ultrathink
```

This removes the symlink the install created, not your clone. Grok's global hook file and rule are removed in step 2.

### Hermes Agent

```sh
hermes plugins disable ultrathink
rm ${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/plugins/ultrathink
```

`rm` removes the symlink only. Then undo the Hermes settings ultrathink asked you to make:

- `plugins.hook_callback_timeout` is a global Hermes setting that applies to every plugin. ultrathink never sets it; you set it during install. If no other plugin needs a long hook cap, put it back to Hermes' default of 30 s:

  ```sh
  hermes config unset plugins.hook_callback_timeout
  ```

- If you set `plugins.entries.ultrathink.allow_gateway_injection` for `/ultrathink-quick` in gateways, remove it:

  ```sh
  hermes config unset plugins.entries.ultrathink
  ```

Restart Hermes, and any running Hermes gateway.

### Muse Code

```sh
muse plugins remove ultrathink
```

### Omp

```sh
omp plugin uninstall ultrathink
```

### Cursor

```sh
bun <clone>/scripts/cursor-plugin.ts remove
```

That deletes the `ultrathink-cursor-managed` `beforeSubmitPrompt` entry and the staged hook under `~/.cursor/hooks`. It leaves pstack and substrate hook entries. It does not remove Agent Swarm's `.cursor/agents` from a workspace.

### Prime Agent

`scripts/setup.ts rollback` (step 2) removes the symlinks `hosts/prime-agent` in `${PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.prime/agent}/skills/ultrathink` and the agent skills in `~/.agents/skills`. If you linked them manually, remove those symlinks:

```sh
rm ${PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.prime/agent}/skills/ultrathink
rm ~/.agents/skills/ultrathink-*
```

## 2. Undo `scripts/setup.ts apply`

Skip this step if you never ran `bun scripts/setup.ts apply`.

```sh
bun <clone>/scripts/setup.ts rollback
```

`rollback` undoes what `apply` recorded, and prints one line per item:

| Item | What `rollback` does |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` tracking block | Removes the block between `<!-- ultrathink:start -->` and `<!-- ultrathink:end -->` from `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/CLAUDE.md`. The rest of the file stays. |
| Claude Code `notion` and `linear` MCP servers | For each one that any `apply` run added (a re-run of `apply` keeps earlier records), checks it with `claude mcp get` and runs `claude mcp remove --scope user` only while it is still the user-scope HTTP server `apply` added, with the hosted URL. A changed entry is reported as `left in place: <name> was changed since setup added it`, a missing one as `already removed`, and a server that was configured before `apply` as `left in place (setup did not add it)`. |
| Setup state file | Deletes `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/ultrathink-setup-state.json`, where `apply` recorded which servers it added. If `claude` failed, the line says `removal failed (…)` and the state file is kept, so running `rollback` again retries it; or run the printed `claude mcp remove --scope user <name>` yourself. |
| Grok hook file | Deletes `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/hooks/ultrathink.json`. |
| Grok rule | Removes the ultrathink block from `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/rules/ultrathink.md`. The file is deleted when nothing else is left in it; text you added around the block stays. |
| Claude Code plugin | Not removed. The last line prints `claude plugin uninstall ultrathink@ultrathink && claude plugin marketplace remove ultrathink` for you to run (step 1). |

If you replaced the hosted `notion` and `linear` servers with gateway entries (`mcp-register --replace`), `rollback` leaves those in place; step 3 removes them.

## 3. Remove the MCP gateway entries

Skip this step if you never ran `bun scripts/mcp-register.ts`.

```sh
bun <clone>/scripts/mcp-register.ts --remove --dry-run   # show what would be removed
bun <clone>/scripts/mcp-register.ts --remove
```

`--remove` deletes only ultrathink's `notion`, `linear` and `greptile` entries, meaning entries whose command ends in `/bin/ultrathink-mcp`. A same-named entry that runs something else is left in place and reported as `kept`. Hosts whose CLI (`claude`, `grok`, `hermes`) is not on `PATH` are skipped. Limit the run with `--hosts` and `--providers` if you only want some of them removed. Only user-scope entries are touched; same-named local or project entries are left alone.

Every file the script changed, now or when you registered, has a backup next to it named `<file>.bak-ultrathink-mcp-<timestamp>`. Delete the backups once you are happy with the result:

| Host | Config file |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~}/.claude.json` |
| Grok Build | `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/config.toml` |
| Hermes Agent | `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/config.yaml`, or with an active Hermes profile `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/profiles/<name>/config.yaml` |
| Muse Code | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/muse/settings.json` |
| Omp | `${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.omp/agent}/mcp.json` |

## 4. Delete stored credentials

The credential store holds one entry per provider. Remove the ones you stored:

```sh
<clone>/bin/ultrathink-mcp auth logout notion
<clone>/bin/ultrathink-mcp auth logout linear
<clone>/bin/ultrathink-mcp auth logout greptile
<clone>/bin/ultrathink-mcp auth logout hindsight
<clone>/bin/ultrathink-mcp auth logout ragflow
```

Each prints `<provider>: logged out`, for example `hindsight: logged out`. There is no flag that drops every provider at once: the usage line is `ultrathink-mcp auth logout <provider>`. OpenRouter, if you stored a key for Jev decisions, is the same command with `openrouter`.

or delete the file itself: `$ULTRATHINK_MCP_STORE` if you set it, otherwise `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/ultrathink/mcp-credentials.json`. A `mcp-credentials.json.lock` directory next to it, if one is left, can go too.

`auth logout` only deletes the local copy. To revoke the access you granted, remove the ultrathink connection or API key in your Notion, Linear, Greptile, Hindsight or RAGFlow account settings.

If you used `auth login --tailscale` and a login was interrupted before it finished, the temporary `tailscale serve` handler may still be there. Remove it with:

```sh
tailscale serve --https=443 --set-path=/ultrathink-oauth off
```

## 5. Delete config files

Delete the ultrathink config files you created. Any of them may be absent.

- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/ultrathink/config.json`
- `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/ultrathink.json`
- `<project>/.claude/ultrathink.json` in each project where you added one

## 6. Delete planning state

Each host keeps its own state directory: control state, planned sessions, specs and claims. Delete the ones that exist:

| Host | State directory |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/ultrathink` |
| Grok Build | `$GROK_PLUGIN_DATA/ultrathink` if set, otherwise `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/plugin-data/ultrathink` |
| Hermes Agent | `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/ultrathink`, and `ultrathink` in each Hermes profile directory you used it in (`${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/profiles/<name>`) |
| Muse Code | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/muse/ultrathink` |
| Omp | `${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.omp/agent}/ultrathink` |
| Prime Agent | `${PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.prime/agent}/ultrathink` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/ultrathink` |

If you set `ULTRATHINK_STATE_DIR`, the state is in that directory instead. Unset the variable too.

Each of those directories may contain a `teach` subdirectory: local lessons (`moments/`), pending Hindsight writes (`outbox/`), an observe inbox (`inbox/`) and skill drafts (`skill-drafts/`). Deleting the state directory removes it. To drop lessons without removing the rest of that host's state, delete only `<state dir>/teach`. ultrathink never writes lessons into a repository or into `.planning/`.

## 7. Delete the clone

```sh
rm -rf <clone>
```

A Claude Code install from the GitHub marketplace has no clone. Step 1 removed it.

## What stays in Notion and Linear

Rows ultrathink created stay where they are: Notion Task, Issue and Sub-Issue rows, the Notion database that `ultrathink-mcp notion init` created, and Linear issues and sub-issues. Delete them in Notion and Linear if you no longer want them. Pull requests and branches that ship opened on GitHub also stay.

## What stays on Hindsight and RAGFlow

Logout deletes the local key only. The Hindsight bank (default name `ultrathink`, or the `hindsight.bank` you set) and the documents ultrathink retained in it stay on the Hindsight server. RAGFlow datasets are not touched. There is no ultrathink command that deletes the configured bank. Delete the bank in Hindsight, and revoke the API key in the Hindsight or RAGFlow account, if you no longer want them. A `hindsight check --roundtrip` throwaway bank (`ultrathink-smoke-…`) is deleted by that command itself; uninstall does not look for one.

## Reinstalling later

Follow [Install](../install.md) or [Getting started](../getting-started.md) again. To move a working install to another directory instead of reinstalling, see [Upgrade and move](upgrade-and-move.md).
