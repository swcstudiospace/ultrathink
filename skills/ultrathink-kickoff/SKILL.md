name: ultrathink-kickoff
description: Invoked with a stateFile path after the ultrathink planner ran an uplift+Graph-of-Thought+HITL pass on any host (the Claude Code or Grok UserPromptSubmit hook, or the Hermes/Muse/Omp entry). The planner may already have created some or all of the Linear issues/sub-issues and Notion Task/Issue/Sub-Issue rows through the shared MCP gateway (Claude Code, Grok, Muse, Omp) or left all of them to this skill (Hermes); this skill finishes or creates them with one command (manual MCP fallback only if that command cannot run), resolves blocking clarifications, sets the Task to Implementing, hands back the full spec plus linked TODO lines and marks the session kicked off. Do not invoke this for any other purpose.

# ultrathink-kickoff

You were told to invoke this skill with `stateFile=<path>` (on Hermes it loads with `skill_view name="ultrathink:ultrathink-kickoff"`; plugin skills load as `ultrathink:<name>`). Follow these steps in order. Tracking must be real (rows exist, links resolve) in every configured tracker before you start engineering work.

## 0. Read the state

Read the JSON file at `stateFile`. It is a `SessionRecord`:

```ts
interface IssueRef { id: string; identifier: string; url: string; title: string }
interface SessionRecord {
	sessionId: string;
	engine?: string;
	host?: string;
	result: { xml: string; original: string; root: string; source: "llm" | "fallback" };
	graph?: { goal: string; nodes: Array<{ id: string; title: string; kind: string; question: string; dependsOn: string[]; thinking?: string; conclusion?: string }> };
	clarifications?: Array<{ id: string; question: string; header: string; why: string; options: Array<{ label: string; description?: string }>; default?: string; blocking: boolean; answer?: string }>;
	plan?: {
		graphId: string;
		task: { graphId: string; item: string; description: string; upliftedPrompt: string; agent: string; status: string; linearState: string; repo?: string; branch?: string };
		issues: Array<{ graphId: string; nodeId: string; item: string; thought: string }>;
		subIssues: Array<{ graphId: string; nodeId: string; item: string; step: number; thought: string }>; // several per nodeId — one per rationale step
		linearIssues: Array<{ nodeId: string; title: string; description: string }>;
		linearSubIssues: Array<{ nodeId: string; step: number; title: string; description: string }>;
		hitl: { blocking: Array<Clarification>; nonBlocking: Array<Clarification> };
	};
	tracking?: {
		graphId: string;
		status: "complete" | "partial" | "failed";
		linearTeam?: string;
		linear: { nodes: Record<string, IssueRef>; steps: Record<string, IssueRef> }; // steps keyed "<nodeId>.<step>"
		notion: { taskUrl?: string; nodes: Record<string, string>; steps: Record<string, string> };
		errors: string[];
		updatedAt: number;
	};
}
```

The spec file is the same path with `.xml` instead of `.json` (`sessions/<id>.xml`); the prompt context also names it as the spec path.

If `plan` is missing (the planner fell back to boilerplate), take the no-plan path: skip steps 1–3 (no rows to finish, nothing to register), resolve clarifications in step 4 from `record.clarifications`, then step 5 with the spec file (or `result.xml`) as the final prompt — do not block on tracking. This is the fail-open path.

## 1. Finish tracking

Rows go to the Notion data source `notion.dataSourceUrl` (a `collection://…` URL) and the Linear team `linear.team` from the ultrathink config: `~/.config/ultrathink/config.json`, `~/.claude/ultrathink.json` and `<project>/.claude/ultrathink.json`, later files winning. `<repo>/bin/ultrathink status`, run from the project directory, prints both as `Notion: …` and `Linear team: …` (`not configured` when unset); `<repo>` is the plugin root (this file is `<repo>/skills/ultrathink-kickoff/SKILL.md`). Skip a tracker that is not configured silently: create nothing in it and do not mention it. If the user asks to set up Notion tracking, `<repo>/bin/ultrathink-mcp notion init --parent <page url or id> --write-config` creates the database and saves its `notion.dataSourceUrl` to `~/.config/ultrathink/config.json`.

- If `tracking.status` is `"complete"`: every row exists in each configured tracker. Skip all row creation and go to step 3.
- Otherwise — `tracking` is absent (on Hermes the planner creates no rows, so it always is on the first run) or not complete — and the state file has a `plan`, run the command printed in the prompt's **Ultrathink tracking** section once with the shell tool (without a `plan` there are no rows to finish: skip to step 4, reading `record.clarifications`):

  ```sh
  <repo>/bin/ultrathink-mcp track complete --state <stateFile>
  ```

  It creates only the missing Linear/Notion rows through the shared MCP gateway (reusing the host's stored OAuth logins), updates `tracking` in the state file, rewrites the spec's `<ISSUES>` block and prints the Linked-issues TODO lines. Re-read the state file afterwards. If it reports that tracking is not configured or turned off, go to step 3 without mentioning it. If it reports `notion: login required`, tell the user to run `<repo>/bin/ultrathink-mcp auth login notion` and continue — do not block.
- **Fail open when a tracker fails.** If the command reports that Notion or Linear is down, unreachable, rate-limited, unauthorised or returned errors (`! …` lines, `tracking partial` or `tracking failed`), do not create rows by hand: tell the user in one line which tracker failed and continue to step 3.
- Only if the command itself cannot run (the `bin/ultrathink-mcp` file is missing, `bun` is missing, or the shell exits 127 or 126), do step 2 manually — never because a tracker is down.

## 2. Manual fallback (only when step 1's command could not run)

Create only what `tracking` does not already contain. This step needs the Notion and Linear MCP tools in this session; if a tracker's tools are not available, tell the user once to register them with `bun <repo>/scripts/mcp-register.ts` (or connect the official Notion/Linear MCP servers), skip that tracker and continue — never block the work.

**Linear** (team = `tracking.linearTeam`, else the configured `linear.team`; skip Linear when neither is set):

1. Look up existing issues first: `list_issues` with `query` = `ultrathink graph <plan.graphId>`. Every issue the planner creates ends its description with the footer `ultrathink graph <graphId> · node <nodeId>` (plus ` · step <n>` for sub-issues); reuse matches instead of creating duplicates.
2. For each `plan.linearIssues` entry without a ref, in dependency order: `save_issue` with `team`, `title`, `description` (keep the footer), and `blockedBy` = identifiers of the node's `dependsOn` issues.
3. For each `plan.linearSubIssues` entry without a ref: `save_issue` with `team`, `title`, `description`, `parentId` = the node issue's identifier. Batch independent creates; if one fails, still create the rest and report which `nodeId`/`step` failed.

**Notion** (data source = the configured `notion.dataSourceUrl`; skip Notion when it is not set): `notion-fetch` the data source once for the schema and send only properties that exist. Find existing rows by `Graph ID` = `plan.graphId` (query tool SQL mode: `SELECT url, "Level", "Item" FROM "<data-source-url>" WHERE "Graph ID" = ?`). Then create with `notion-create-pages`:

- Task row: `Item`, `Level`=`Task`, `Description`, `Uplifted Prompt`, `Agent` (= `plan.task.agent`; if the select rejects it, omit it — never substitute `claude-code`), `Status`, `Linear State`, `Repo`, `Branch`, `Graph ID`.
- Issue rows (one per node): `Item`, `Level`=`Issue`, `Thought`, `Parent Item` = Task page, `Graph ID`, `Linear URL`, `Issue ID`.
- Sub-Issue rows (one per rationale step — never collapse steps): `Item`, `Level`=`Sub-Issue`, `Step`, `Thought`, `Parent Item` = that node's Issue page, `Graph ID`, `Linear URL`, `Issue ID`.

Keep every identifier/URL you created; steps 3 and 5 use them.

## 3. Optional: register the graph with an Agent Substrate server

This is an optional integration. Run it only when an MCP server named `substrate` is connected in this session and you have its `graph_register` tool; otherwise skip this step silently — do not log, mention or suggest it. When it is connected, call `graph_register` on it. It is idempotent by `graph_id`, so call it without checking for an earlier registration. On Cursor the session record's `host` is `cursor`; pass that as `surface` (the same rule as every other host: `claude-code` only when `host` is absent). Build it from the tracking refs, leaving out fields whose value is absent:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `graph_id` | `plan.graphId` (required) |
| `notion_task_page` | `tracking.notion.taskUrl` |
| `repo` / `branch` | `plan.task.repo` / `plan.task.branch`, when set |
| `surface` | the record's `host`; `claude-code` only when `host` is absent. `prime-agent` is not a Substrate surface: send `pi` |
| `status` | `plan.task.status` |
| `pr_url` | the PR URL, only when one exists (a fresh plan has none: leave it out) |
| `nodes` | per node: `node_id`, `linear_issue_id` (`linear.nodes[n].id`), `linear_identifier`, `notion_page` (`notion.nodes[n]`), `state` |
| `steps` | per step key: `node_id`, `step`, `linear_sub_issue_id`, `notion_page` (`notion.steps[key]`), `state` |
| `edges` | per dependency in the Graph of Thought: `from_node` = the dependent node, `to_node` = the node it depends on, `kind` = `requires` |

`state` is one of `backlog`, `unstarted`, `started`, `started_review`, `completed`, `canceled`, `duplicate`, taken from `plan.task.status` (for example `Todo` is `unstarted`, `Implementing` is `started`, `Done` is `completed`). Leave it out when the status names none of them (`Planning` does not) rather than guessing. Never send `linear_url` on nodes, or `linear_identifier` or `linear_url` on steps: the Substrate schema does not accept them.

**Fail open.** If the call errors, log one line and continue. Do not retry or ask the user.

## 4. Resolve HITL clarifications

Without a `plan`, read `record.clarifications` instead of `plan.hitl`: blocking questions are those with `blocking: true` and no `answer`, non-blocking those with `blocking: false` and no `answer` (already-answered items stay answered).

- For every item in `plan.hitl.nonBlocking`: proceed with its `default` option and state the assumption plainly in your next message (do not ask about it).
- For every item in `plan.hitl.blocking` (at most 4, already deduplicated): call the host's question tool **once** (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `ask` in Omp, `clarify` in Hermes), passing all of them together — each with its `header`, `question`, and `options` (the option matching `default` first). If no question tool is available, proceed with every blocking default and say so.
- On Hermes, that one call is `clarify` with `{"questions": [{"question": "<header>: <question>", "choices": ["<default label>", "<other option label>", …]}]}` — at most 4 choices per question with the default first (Hermes labels the first choice Recommended and adds Other itself) and at most 5 questions. If an answer says no user is available (Hermes `-q`/`-z` modes) or the tool errors, proceed with every blocking default and say so.
- Persist the user's answers into the spec before anything reads it (step 5 and any Cursor handoff): in `sessions/<id>.xml`, add `<ANSWER source="user">…</ANSWER>` (answer text XML-escaped) inside the `<CLARIFICATION>` of the question it answers, after `</OPTIONS>`. The `<CLARIFICATIONS>` block already holds one `<CLARIFICATION>` per blocking question. Replace an existing `<ANSWER>` rather than adding a second. If the block has no entry for a question, append one in the same format. An answer kept only in chat never reaches the spec, so the orchestrator would build the default instead. Stated assumptions need no entry: the default option already carries `recommended="true"`.

## 5. Set Implementing and emit the final prompt
When the plan carries the Cursor swarm note (`## Cursor swarm`), do steps 1 and 4 only, then stop. The Cursor session hands the unit to `a01-orchestrator`, so do not emit the final prompt in steps 2 and 3 here.

1. Set the Task `Status` to `"Implementing"`: `notion-update-page` on `tracking.notion.taskUrl` when present (skip silently when absent). If the Notion MCP tools are not available in this session, tell the user once to register them with `bun <repo>/scripts/mcp-register.ts` (or connect the official Notion MCP server), skip this update and continue — never block the work.
2. The final prompt is the **full spec file** (`sessions/<id>.xml`, the spec path from the prompt context), which already carries the `<ISSUES>` block with identifiers and URLs. Do not use `plan.task.upliftedPrompt` — that copy is truncated to 1900 characters.
3. Copy every **Linked issues** TODO line into the host TODO tool verbatim, keeping the identifier and URL on each line. When step 1 ran `track complete`, take the lines from its output — the prompt-context lines are stale then (they still show `(pending)` rows); otherwise take them from the prompt context (without a `plan` there are none — skip).
4. Mark the session kicked off, once: `<repo>/bin/ultrathink-mcp session mark --state <stateFile> kicked-off`. Fail open: if it errors, ignore it and continue.

## 6. Proceed as normal

Skip this section when the plan carries the Cursor swarm note (`## Cursor swarm`). The Cursor session hands the unit to `a01-orchestrator`, which dispatches the waves itself; dispatching them here would start the same work twice and let both sets of agents edit the same files. Otherwise, treat the spec as the actual task. Dispatch the graph's WORKFLOW waves as parallel subagents with the host's subagent tool (`Task` in Claude Code, `task` in Omp), passing each subagent the Linear/Notion URLs of the node(s) it owns (without a `plan` there are no URLs to pass). Reference issues in commits as `Refs <identifier>` and in PR bodies as `Fixes <identifier>`. Do not re-read this skill again this turn.
