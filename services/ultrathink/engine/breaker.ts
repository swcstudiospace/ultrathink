/**
 * Upstream circuit breaker for the OpenRouter completer (Refs SPE-17437).
 *
 * Pure state machine, no I/O, no logging and no timers: time comes from the
 * injected `now` clock and every transition is reported through
 * `onTransition` so the integrator can wire logs and metrics.
 *
 * States:
 * - `closed`: calls flow; failures are counted in a fixed window of `windowMs`
 *   starting at the first failure. When the window rolls the count restarts
 *   at the new failure. Reaching `failureThreshold` inside one window opens
 *   the breaker.
 * - `open`: `tryAcquire` refuses with the remaining `retryAfterMs` until
 *   `openMs` has elapsed since `openedAt`; the first `tryAcquire` after that
 *   moves to `half_open` and hands out a probe slot.
 * - `half_open`: at most `halfOpenMaxCalls` probes in flight; extra callers
 *   are refused with `retryAfterMs = HALF_OPEN_RETRY_MS` so they back off
 *   briefly instead of hammering. A probe released with `success` closes the
 *   breaker and resets counters; `failure` re-opens it with a fresh
 *   `openedAt`; `ignored` only frees the slot.
 *
 * `state()` and `snapshot()` are pure reads of the stored state: an open
 * breaker whose `openMs` has elapsed still reports `open` until a caller asks
 * for a probe slot via `tryAcquire`, which is the only place the
 * open -> half_open transition happens (so `onTransition` fires exactly once,
 * for the request that gets the probe).
 *
 * Fail-open semantics belong to the caller: this module only refuses slots.
 * The completer maps a refusal to `upstream_unavailable` and the service keeps
 * serving every non-planning tool while the upstream is cut off. Nothing here
 * throws after construction; `onTransition` exceptions are swallowed.
