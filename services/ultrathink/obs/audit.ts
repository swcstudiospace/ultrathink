/**
 * Tamper-evident security audit trail (Refs SPE-17437).
 *
 * An append-only JSON Lines file, one record per line, each record carrying the SHA-256 of the previous record so
 * that editing, removing or reordering any line breaks the chain from that line on. The file is created `0600` and
 * every append is fsynced; security events are rare, so durability wins over throughput.
 *
 * Phase 68 adds three things to the chain:
 * - Merkle anchors (CONTEXT D1, D2): after every `anchorEvery` records the log appends an `audit_anchor` whose root
 *   commits to every record before it (see `audit-merkle.ts`). An in-place edit of an earlier record is caught by the
 *   anchor even when the attacker recomputes the chain hashes. A full rewrite that recomputes the anchors too is only
 *   caught by a copy held elsewhere (`audit-cli.ts verify --expect <seq>:<hash>`).
 * - Sealed segments (CONTEXT D9): when the active file would exceed `segmentBytes` it is renamed to
 *   `audit-<firstSeq>-<lastSeq>.jsonl` and made read-only. The chain continues across the files.
 * - Retention (CONTEXT D10): `prune()` deletes the oldest sealed segments past a cutoff and records the boundary in an
 *   `audit_retention_pruned` event, carrying the anchor frontier, so the remaining chain still verifies and its anchors
 *   keep covering every record.
 *
 * The log is tamper-evident, not tamper-proof: whoever can rewrite the whole file can recompute the whole chain, and
 * removing records from the *end* is only visible against an externally kept `lastHash`. Operators who need that
 * guarantee ship the `verify()` result (or `audit-cli.ts verify`) off-host periodically.
