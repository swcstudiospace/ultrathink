// Weighted admission for a bounded pool (Phase 70, RATE-03).
//
// Priority classes: `owner` may take any free slot; `connector` and `bearer` may not take the last `reserve`
// slots and may not hold more than `perPrincipalMax` slots per principal.
//
// `acquire` refuses at once. `admit` waits instead: an over-budget admission joins a bounded FIFO queue for its
// class, and a freed slot goes to the head of the highest-priority class whose head fits the budget. A waiter is
// granted in arrival order within its class. An admission that fits takes a free slot at once, even when a waiter of
// its class is blocked by its own principal cap. A full queue refuses at once; an expired or aborted wait leaves the
// queue. Refusals and expiries are reported to the security logger when one is given.
//
// Construction throws `RangeError` for invalid options.
