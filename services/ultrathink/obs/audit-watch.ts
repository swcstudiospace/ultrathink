/**
 * In-process tamper watch for the audit file (AUDIT-04, CONTEXT D6).
 *
 * Each tick compares the file's current fingerprint with the fingerprint the log wrote last. Writes made by the log
 * itself match and cost nothing. A different fingerprint triggers one full chain scan, which alerts when the chain is
 * broken or when the disk head differs from the acknowledged head. Every `fullScanEveryTicks` ticks a full scan runs
 * even when the fingerprint matches, which catches an in-place edit that keeps size, mtime and inode.
 * A tick whose fingerprint matches the acknowledged one never clears an alert; only a full scan that comes back healthy does.
 *
 * The watch never writes to the chain. Alerts go to `onAlert`; the caller decides where they land.
 * `stat` and `acknowledged` are expected not to throw. `scan` runs off the tick: it resolves later, and one scan is in flight at a time. A full scan due while one is in flight is owed to the next tick.
