# ultrathink

ultrathink is a planner plugin for coding agents. Before the agent sees a non-trivial prompt, ultrathink rewrites it into an XML spec, builds a Graph of Thought that ends in a WORKFLOW of parallel waves, drafts the clarifying questions whose answers would change the work, and, if you configure it, creates matching Linear issues and Notion rows. The agent then starts from that plan. It runs on Claude Code, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, Muse Code, Omp and Prime Agent, plans with each host's own engine by default (on Omp, the session's own model) or with the engine you choose, and fails open: a problem inside ultrathink never blocks your prompt.

[![CI](https://github.com/swcstudiospace/claude-ultrathink/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/swcstudiospace/claude-ultrathink/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**New here?** Follow [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) to install ultrathink and plan your first prompt. Everything else is in the [documentation index](docs/README.md).

## Why

A coding agent starts on the prompt exactly as typed. For anything larger than a one-line fix, the scope, the order of the work and the questions worth settling first are left for the agent to work out as it goes, and whatever plan it forms stays inside that one session. ultrathink adds one planning pass in front of the agent: a written spec, a dependency graph whose independent parts can run in parallel, the blocking questions asked once up front, and, if you want them, tracker rows for every part of the plan. One engine and one config serve all seven hosts.

## What happens on a prompt

1. **Filter.** The host's prompt hook runs before the model sees your message. It handles the `/ultrathink-*` commands and lets these through unplanned: `/ultrathink-quick` and `raw:` messages, short replies such as `ok` or `lgtm`, slash commands that are not skills, subagent sessions, and everything while planning is off. A skill invocation is planned together with the text you typed. A `/gsd-*` or `/skill:gsd-*` command is planned even when no skill file is installed.
2. **Uplift.** The engine rewrites the message into an XML spec. Your own words stay verbatim in its `ORIGINAL` element.
3. **Graph of Thought.** The engine splits the work into 5 to 8 nodes (by default) with dependencies and gives each node a rationale and a conclusion. The final node writes a WORKFLOW: waves of file-disjoint units, where the units of one wave can run in parallel.
4. **Clarify.** It drafts up to 4 HITL questions. The agent first tries to answer them from the repository; blocking questions that remain are asked once, before any code is written, and the rest go ahead with their recommended default.
5. **Track (optional).** For each provider that is configured and logged in, it creates rows through the shared MCP gateway: a Notion Task row for the prompt, a Linear issue and a Notion Issue row per node, and a Linear sub-issue and a Notion Sub-Issue row per rationale step. A node's Linear issue is blocked by the issues of the nodes it depends on.
6. **Inject.** It saves the spec and session state in the host's state directory and puts the plan into the agent's context. A planned prompt can include a "Lessons from earlier work" section and a "Docs" section from RAGFlow (the heading is "Documents (RAGFlow)"), both untrusted evidence, both absent when the feature is off or the call fails.
7. **Execute.** With tracking on, the agent first runs `ultrathink-kickoff`. Then it works through the waves: the plan tells it to run the units of a wave as parallel subagents, to verify each wave before starting the next, and to prefer repository evidence where the plan disagrees with it.

    M[Your message] --> H{Prompt hook}
    H -->|"control command"| R["Hook replies, no model turn"]
    H -->|"quick message, raw:, short reply, planning off"| A["Agent gets the message unplanned"]
    H -->|"plan"| U["Uplift: XML spec"]
    U --> G["Graph of Thought: nodes and WORKFLOW waves"]

    Q --> T["Linear and Notion rows, when configured"]
    T --> I["Plan in the agent's context"]
    I --> K["ultrathink-kickoff, then the waves"]
```

Each step fails open. If the engine fails, the agent gets a conservative spec and nothing is tracked. If a tracker fails, the plan still arrives and `ultrathink-kickoff` tries the missing rows again. If Bun is missing, the hooks exit quietly and the prompt goes through unplanned.

The agent-side half is four skills, shared by every host:

| Skill | Runs | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `ultrathink-kickoff` | First, when tracking is on | Finishes missing tracker rows, resolves blocking questions, hands back the full spec and the linked TODO lines |
| `ultrathink-plan` | On a host that drops hook output (Grok Build) | Reads this session's plan from `last-plan.<sessionId>.json`, then runs kickoff |
| `ultrathink-sync` | After a pull request opens, or at a stopping point | Puts the PR link, checks and status on the tracked rows; never creates rows |
| `ultrathink-ship` | After a planned GSD skill run, only when ship is turned on | Done check, pull request, Greptile review to 5/5; merge and branch cleanup only when you enable them (see [Ship](#ship)) |

## Supported hosts

Each host except Cursor was tested live with the version shown, including planning and the `/ultrathink-*` commands described under [Skip ultrathink for quick messages](#skip-ultrathink-for-quick-messages). On Omp, planning on the session's own model was verified live on 18.8.0 in print mode. The Cursor adapter is present in source; a live Cursor session has not been verified.

| Host | Tested | How ultrathink loads | How the plan reaches the agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | 2.1.278 | `.claude-plugin/` marketplace; hooks in `hooks/hooks.json` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook context |
| Grok Build | 1.0.41 | The plugin directory supplies the skills and commands. Grok does not dispatch plugin hooks, so `bun scripts/setup.ts apply` installs the global hook file `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/hooks/ultrathink.json` | Grok discards hook output, so the plan is written to the session's own `last-plan.<sessionId>.json` and a rule file (`${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/rules/ultrathink.md`) tells the model to read it |
| Hermes Agent | v0.21.4 | Python plugin `hosts/hermes` (Python 3.10 or later), symlinked into `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/plugins/ultrathink` | `pre_llm_call` gets the plan from `hooks/engine.ts` and hands the agent a short handoff: the spec path, the state file and the Graph ID |
| Muse Code | 1.4.0 | `.muse-plugin/plugin.json` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook context, same entry as Claude Code |
| Prime Agent | 0.9.8 | Python-backed kernel skill `hosts/prime-agent`, linked into `${PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.prime/agent}/skills/ultrathink` by `bun scripts/setup.ts apply`; the `ultrathink-*` agent skills are linked into `~/.agents/skills` | Prime Agent has no prompt hook: the agent calls `await ultrathink("<request>")` in its persistent Python kernel, the skill runs `hooks/engine.ts` and returns the plan (`context`, the spec and its path) to the kernel. The agent then runs the waves, with `ultrathink-kickoff` first when tracking is on |
| Omp | 18.3.1 (native planning: 18.8.0) | `package.json` `omp.extensions` → `src/host/omp.ts` | `before_agent_start` plans inside Omp on the session's own model, with Omp's own provider and login (see [Choose the planning engine](docs/how-to/choose-engine.md#omp-the-sessions-own-model)); the TUI shows a live status bar and plan cards. Omp caps a handler at 30 s, so the extension waits up to 25 s and a slower plan arrives later as an aside |
| Cursor | source only | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` plus `bun scripts/cursor-plugin.ts install` | `beforeSubmitPrompt` runs `hooks/engine.ts` and injects `additional_context`. SDLC work is handed to the `a01-orchestrator` subagent when Agent Swarm's Cursor agents are installed |

With Teachable Moments on, the Hermes plugin registers the tools `ultrathink_lesson_save` and `ultrathink_lesson_recall` and the commands `/ultrathink-learn` and `/ultrathink-lessons`. The plan handoff stays short: the spec path, the state file and the Graph ID.

Every plan records which model planned it and why, in one of four states: `detected` (Omp's live session model), `default` (a built-in or provider default), `override` (a model you set) or `unresolved` (none could be used; the prompt goes through unplanned with the reason). See [Planning model states](docs/how-to/choose-engine.md#planning-model-states).

On Omp, `/ultrathink-ui [overview|jev|moments|skills|card]` opens a native keyboard-driven dashboard (no browser, no extra runtime) over saved Jev decisions, project lessons and skill autonomy, or publishes a captured summary card. See [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md#omp).

### Cross-agent discovery

claude-ultrathink is a cross-agent reasoning plugin for prompt uplift, Graph of Thought, Chain of Thought and HITL clarifications, with optional Linear/Notion tracking and Greptile-gated shipping. Existing adapters serve Claude Code, Grok Build, Hermes Agent, Muse, Omp, Prime Agent and Cursor. Loader name: ultrathink. Grok Bot is a native host (`bin/ultrathink-grokbot` plus skills; no prompt hook); its compatibility is not verified. The GPT Dot protocol is pending; its compatibility is unverified. See [Use with Grok Bot](docs/how-to/use-with-grok-bot.md).

[`ultrathink.discovery.json`](ultrathink.discovery.json), with its schema [`ultrathink.discovery.schema.json`](ultrathink.discovery.schema.json), says the same in machine-readable form: the repository identity, the seven adapters with their entry files (status `source-present`: present in the source, not a promise that a given install works), the JSON planner, control and tracker-relay interfaces (only the first one plans), the Grok Bot record (`status` `native-adapter`, `adapterPresent` true, `compatibilityVerified` false, delivery `skill-protocol-cli`) and the pending GPT Dot record, whose `adapterPresent` and `compatibilityVerified` are both `false`. It is a static file read from a checkout, and no host is known to pick it up on its own. It is not a bot adapter or a planning server: it registers nothing and holds no planning-service URL, credential or model default.

### Platforms

ultrathink runs on **Linux** and **macOS**. On Windows, use it inside **WSL**; native Windows is not supported. CI runs on Linux only; macOS is supported but not tested in CI.

Requirements:

- **Bun 1.2 or newer** (tested with 1.4.0). `bin/run-bun` finds Bun even when a host's PATH does not include it. Without Bun the hooks exit quietly and prompts go through unplanned; the `bin/` CLIs print `ultrathink: bun not found` and exit with status 127.
- **An engine:** each host plans with its own engine by default. Claude Code, Hermes and Prime Agent use Claude (the `claude` CLI, Claude Code 2.1.278 or later, or 2.1.293 or later for the default model `claude-haiku-5-5`, installed and signed in with your own Claude plan login; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not used for planning unless you set `claude.auth: "api-key"`; Hermes picks Grok or Muse instead for a Grok or Muse session model), Grok Build uses Grok (`grok login`) and Muse Code uses Muse (the `muse` CLI, logged in). Omp plans on the session's own model through Omp's own provider and login, so planning needs no engine CLI there; under `auto`, Omp's ship done check and Teachable Moments distiller still use the `claude` CLI. The Claude engine passes `--tools ""`, `--strict-mcp-config` and `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`; an older CLI rejects these and every plan falls back to the minimal spec.
- **Memory-bank inference:** the Teachable Moments distiller always runs on `claude-haiku-5-5`, then on `grok-build-0.1` only when `claude.fallbackToGrok` is on and the Grok Build login is signed in (`ultrathink grok login` makes its own login under `grok.home`, never `~/.grok`), whatever `claude.model` or `grok.model` say. Hindsight itself needs no inference. `grok.fallbackModels` is empty by default, so no pricier Grok model is used unless you list one.
- **Hermes Agent only:** Python 3.10 or newer.
- **For ship (optional):** `gh`, authenticated, and Greptile: a Greptile key in the gateway, or the Greptile CLI (tested with 3.4.1) after `greptile login`.

State is kept per host: `~/.claude/ultrathink`, `$GROK_PLUGIN_DATA/ultrathink` if set (otherwise `${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/plugin-data/ultrathink`), `$HERMES_HOME/ultrathink` (default `~/.hermes/ultrathink`), `~/.config/muse/ultrathink` and `~/.omp/agent/ultrathink`. Planning never writes `.planning/` into your working directory.

## Cost and latency

Planning runs on your own engine login. With the defaults one planned prompt makes 8 to 11 engine calls (see [Reduce cost and latency](docs/how-to/reduce-cost-and-latency.md)). On Claude Code, Hermes and Prime Agent they run through `claude -p` on your Claude plan login with `claude-haiku-5-5` unless you set `claude.model`, so they draw from your plan's usage limits and not from an API key; the plan is the holder's own, and Anthropic does not permit routing other people's requests through plan credentials. On Omp under `auto` they run on the session's own model and count against that provider account; on reasoning-heavy models a plan can take several minutes. Node fills run up to `claude.concurrency` (default 3) at a time within a dependency level; the other calls run one after another, and creating tracker rows can add up to `track.budgetMs` (0 by default, which means no limit). The agent starts only when the plan is ready (on Omp, after 25 s at most; a slower plan arrives as an aside).

To spend less: send small messages with `/ultrathink-quick` or a `raw:` prefix, lower `think.maxNodes`, turn clarifying questions off with `hitl.enabled: false`, or turn the graph off with `think.enabled: false`. Short replies such as `ok` are not planned. See [Reduce cost and latency](docs/how-to/reduce-cost-and-latency.md).

## What leaves your machine

- **Always, for a planned prompt:** your message and the recent conversation go to the planning engine: Anthropic through the `claude` CLI by default; on Omp under `auto`, the provider of your Omp session's model, through Omp's own login; or xAI when you choose the Grok engine (or a gateway you run, with the Grok `shunt` transport).
- **By default, for a qualifying finished turn (Teachable Moments):** one extra call to the same planning engine with a redacted excerpt of the session (your messages, the assistant's text, tool calls and tool results; at most 60 turns, 24,000 characters) to distill lessons. It runs when the turn had at least `teach.observeMinToolCalls` tool calls (default 4) and a recovery, a user correction or a failed run. `"teach": { "capture": "explicit" }` stops it; `teach.enabled: false` or `ULTRATHINK_TEACH=0` turns Teachable Moments off. Lessons, recall and skill installs stay on this machine unless Hindsight is on.
- **Only when you configure them:** plan contents (the uplifted prompt, node titles and reasoning, repository name and branch) go to Notion and Linear through their hosted MCP servers; ship pushes to GitHub with `gh` and sends the pull request to Greptile; the Greptile knowledge-base read sends only list and read calls to Greptile (never your prompt or code) and passes the documents it reads to the engine; the Agent Substrate brief request sends the repository, branch and host name to the URL you set, and each planned prompt then sends it one event with the Graph ID, session id, host, repository, branch and node count (never the prompt or the plan).
- **Only with a Jev key:** Jev decisions go to OpenRouter at `openrouter.ai` (`/api/alpha/decisions`) or the Vercel AI Gateway (`ai-gateway.vercel.sh`), picked by `decisions.provider` (`auto` prefers Vercel when its key exists). `ULTRATHINK_DECISIONS=0` turns them off for a process. Each request carries a small, capped state for one yes/no question: the message and the last assistant turn (plan gate), the request, acceptance criteria and patch (ship), a knowledge-base question, answer and cited document (knowledge), or the task, question and default answer (blocking). The `teachable` and `skillworthy` points send a clipped lesson (name, description, body cut to 800 characters, kind, and occurrences for `skillworthy`) whenever that point is listed and a key exists. OpenRouter requests ask for zero data retention and `data_collection: "deny"` by default. The OpenRouter key is for Jev only: `decisions.model` accepts only `typesafe/jev*` ids, nothing falls back to another model, provider or key, and no child process inherits the key.
- **Only when `hindsight.enabled` is on and a key exists** (the credential store, else `HINDSIGHT_API_KEY`, else `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN`; the stored key wins): lesson text and the recall query go to the Hindsight URL you set (`hindsight.url` or `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`). The recall query is your original prompt, cut to 1,500 characters. Nothing is sent while Hindsight is off, has no URL or has no key, or while `ULTRATHINK_HINDSIGHT=0`.
- **Only when `ragflow.ground` is on** (which also needs `ragflow.enabled`, a URL and a key): the grounding query, your original prompt cut to 1,500 characters, goes to RAGFlow. Nothing is sent while grounding is off or RAGFlow is not ready, or while `ULTRATHINK_RAGFLOW=0`.
- Credentials for Notion, Linear, Greptile, OpenRouter, Hindsight and RAGFlow stay in one local file, `~/.config/ultrathink/mcp-credentials.json` (mode 0600). ultrathink has no telemetry of its own.

Details for every service: [What leaves your machine](docs/privacy.md).

## Optional integrations (off by default)

A fresh install plans prompts and contacts nothing but the engine. External integrations stay off until you turn them on:

| Integration | Turn it on with | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Notion and Linear tracking | `notion.dataSourceUrl`, `linear.team` | Creates rows for each plan (see [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md#6-optional-track-plans-in-notion-or-linear)) |
| Ship | `ship.enabled: true`; merging also needs `ship.autoMerge: true`, branch deletion `ship.deleteBranch: true`; `ship.judge: "advisory"` lets the deterministic checks alone decide when to open the pull request | Opens a pull request after a GSD skill run and reviews it with Greptile (see [Ship](#ship)) |
| Greptile knowledge base | `hitl.knowledgeBase: true` and a stored Greptile credential | Reads the repository's Greptile knowledge base before the clarifying questions and settles the ones it answers (see [Use the Greptile knowledge base](docs/how-to/use-greptile-knowledge-base.md)) |
| Agent Substrate | `substrate.url` or `SUBSTRATE_URL` | Fetches a cross-agent brief for the repository and branch before the graph is built, and sends the substrate each plan's Graph ID afterwards |
| Tailscale OAuth callback | `bin/ultrathink-mcp auth login <provider> --tailscale` or `ULTRATHINK_OAUTH_TAILSCALE=1` | Receives the OAuth callback over `tailscale serve` for logins on a remote machine |
| Grok `shunt` transport | `grok.transport: "shunt"` plus `grok.shuntBaseUrl` | Sends Grok engine calls to an Anthropic-compatible gateway you run; there is no built-in one |
| Claude to Grok fallback | `claude.fallbackToGrok: true` in your user config (default off) | When a Claude call fails (plan limit, authentication, billing, rate limit, overload, model unavailable, CLI missing, network), the call is retried on the Grok route, so your prompt text goes to xAI. Needs a `grok login` session |
| Jev decisions (OpenRouter Decisions API) | An OpenRouter key (`bin/ultrathink-mcp auth set-key openrouter --stdin`, or `ULTRATHINK_OPENROUTER_KEY`; the generic `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is no longer read). Always on once a key exists; only `ULTRATHINK_DECISIONS=0` turns it off | Asks the `~typesafe/jev-latest` decision model one yes/no question at each listed point (six by default, including `teachable` and `skillworthy`), after the deterministic rules: skip planning for a message that is not new work, veto an incomplete ship "done" (or, without auto-merge, judge it when there is no LLM verdict), reject a knowledge-base answer the document does not support, promote a risky default to a blocking question (see [Use Jev decisions](docs/how-to/use-jev-decisions.md)) |
| Hindsight | `hindsight.enabled: true` in your user config (default off), a URL (`hindsight.url` or `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`) and a key (`bin/ultrathink-mcp auth set-key hindsight --stdin`, or `HINDSIGHT_API_KEY`) | Stores lesson text and answers the recall query (see [Connect Hindsight](docs/how-to/connect-hindsight.md)) |
| RAGFlow grounding | `ragflow.ground: true` in your user config (default off; also needs `ragflow.enabled`, a URL and a key: `bin/ultrathink-mcp auth set-key ragflow --stdin`, or `RAGFLOW_API_KEY`) | Sends the grounding query and adds excerpts to the plan (see [Connect RAGFlow](docs/how-to/connect-ragflow.md)) |

Teachable Moments operates locally and is **on by default** (`teach.enabled: true`, `capture: "auto"`, `autoPromote: true`): it distills finished turns into lessons, recalls matching lessons and skills into later plans, and installs recurring lessons as skills without human intervention (see [Use Teachable Moments](docs/how-to/use-teachable-moments.md)).

`bin/ultrathink status` shows tracking, Substrate, Ship, the knowledge base, Decisions (the `Decisions:` line), and also `Hindsight:`, `RAGFlow:` and `Teach:`, plus the Grok transport. Every key: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Quickstart

Clone the repository once; every host loads ultrathink from the clone, written `<clone>` below. The runtime has no npm dependencies, so `bun install` is only needed for development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swcstudiospace/claude-ultrathink.git <clone>
```

Then run the lines for each host you use:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add <clone>
claude plugin install ultrathink@ultrathink

# Grok Build: the plugin directory, enable it, then the global hook file and rule file
mkdir -p ${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/plugins && ln -sfn <clone> ${GROK_HOME:-~/.grok}/plugins/ultrathink
grok plugin enable ultrathink
grok plugin list                 # ultrathink should be listed as enabled
bun <clone>/scripts/setup.ts apply

# Hermes Agent: the plugin, then the hook cap (required, see below)
mkdir -p "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/plugins"
ln -sfn <clone>/hosts/hermes "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/plugins/ultrathink"
hermes plugins enable ultrathink
hermes config set plugins.hook_callback_timeout 600

# Muse Code
muse plugins install <clone> --scope user
muse plugins approve ultrathink

# Omp
omp plugin link <clone>

# Prime Agent: setup.ts links hosts/prime-agent into ~/.prime/agent/skills/ultrathink and skills/* into ~/.agents/skills
bun <clone>/scripts/setup.ts apply
```

- **Hermes hook cap.** Hermes stops waiting for a plugin hook after `plugins.hook_callback_timeout` seconds, 30 by default, and a plan takes longer than that. ultrathink plans only when the cap is at least 105 s; 600 (Hermes' maximum) is recommended. It is a global Hermes setting that applies to every plugin, and ultrathink never changes it for you. Below 105 s, every prompt goes through unplanned and the Hermes log gets one warning naming the command above.
- `setup.ts apply` installs the Grok hook file and rule first. If the `claude` CLI is on PATH, it also sets up Claude Code: it installs the plugin, adds the hosted Notion and Linear MCP servers and adds a marked block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Without `claude`, it skips those steps and says so.
- Muse refuses a plugin directory that contains symlinks, and `bun install` can create some under `node_modules/.bin`, so install from a clone where you have not run it (or delete `node_modules` first). Planning starts only after `approve`.
- Check the result with `<clone>/bin/ultrathink status`, then send a request. In Claude Code a `Prompt Uplift · …` line appears before the agent starts.

Per-host details, updating and removing: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

### Optional: track plans in Linear and Notion

Tracking stays off until you configure a provider, and rows are created only for the providers you set up. The short version, from `<clone>`:

```bash
bin/ultrathink-mcp auth login linear      # or: bin/ultrathink-mcp auth set-key linear --stdin
bin/ultrathink-mcp auth login notion
bin/ultrathink-mcp notion init --parent <notion page url or id> --write-config
bun scripts/mcp-register.ts               # give each host's agent the tracker tools
```

Then set `linear.team` to `<your Linear team name>` in `~/.config/ultrathink/config.json`. The walkthrough, with what each step prints: [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md#6-optional-track-plans-in-notion-or-linear). Guides: [Set up Notion](docs/how-to/set-up-notion.md), [Set up Linear](docs/how-to/set-up-linear.md), [Register the MCP gateway](docs/how-to/register-mcp-gateway.md).

## Skip ultrathink for quick messages

The same commands work on every host (on Prime Agent the agent runs them through `ultrathink.ctl(...)`, see [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md#prime-agent)). Nothing changes unless you use one.

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/ultrathink-quick <message>` | Sends only this message to the agent: no planning, no Linear/Notion rows |
| `/ultrathink-skip` | Your next message is not planned |
| `/ultrathink-off`, `/ultrathink-on` | Planning off or on for this host until you change it |
| `/ultrathink-track off`, `/ultrathink-track on` | Keep planning, but stop or start creating Linear/Notion rows |
| `/ultrathink-status` | Show the planning, tracking and engine state |
| `/ultrathink-ui [overview\|jev\|moments\|skills\|card]` (Omp only) | Open the native dashboard, or publish a captured summary card with `card` |

Start a message with `raw:` to send it without planning, or with `uplift:` to plan it even while planning is off. From a shell, `<clone>/bin/ultrathink status`, `off`, `on`, `skip` and `track off|on` do the same. Per-host behavior, Claude Code's plugin-qualified names and environment variables: [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md).

## Ship

Ship is off until you set `"ship": { "enabled": true }`. Then, when a planned run of a GSD skill (GSD, "Get Shit Done", is a family of `gsd-*` agent skills; any skill whose name starts with `gsd-` by default) ends with committed work on a feature branch, ultrathink tells the agent to run the `ultrathink-ship` skill. It checks that the task is really done, pushes the branch, opens a pull request into the default branch and runs Greptile reviews, fixing the findings between rounds, until the score is 5/5 with no open comments. The done check is deterministic rules plus an LLM judge that must agree (`ship.judge: "gate"`, the default); with `ship.judge: "advisory"` the rules alone decide, the judge's verdict goes into the pull request body, and the merge gate stays Greptile 5/5 with no open comments and passing CI. It merges only with `ship.autoMerge: true` (otherwise it leaves the pull request for you) and deletes the branch only with `ship.deleteBranch: true`. `ULTRATHINK_SHIP=0` turns it off for one shell. Setup: [Ship with Greptile](docs/how-to/ship-with-greptile.md). The full flow and every setting: [docs/ship.md](docs/ship.md).

## Configuration

ultrathink runs with no config file. Every host reads the same JSON files, and later files win key by key:

1. `~/.config/ultrathink/config.json` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ultrathink/config.json` when that is set)
2. `~/.claude/ultrathink.json` (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/ultrathink.json` when that is set)
3. `<project>/.claude/ultrathink.json`

To plan with Grok instead of Claude, add `"think": { "engine": "grok" }` and run `grok login` (see [Choose the engine](docs/how-to/choose-engine.md)). `ULTRATHINK_UPLIFT=0` turns planning off in one process, for scripts and headless runs. Every key, its default and every environment variable: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Documentation

Start with [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md). The [documentation index](docs/README.md) lists every guide and reference page: install per host, the how-to guides, configuration, commands, tracking, ship, architecture, privacy and troubleshooting.

Want `/ultrathink` in Claude chat, Claude Code or Grok Chat without installing a host plugin? The hosted connector and its local stdio server are covered in [Use /ultrathink in Claude, Claude Code and Grok Chat](docs/how-to/use-ultrathink-in-chat.md); none of it has been connected to those clients in a live session yet, and the guide says which behavior is verified.
